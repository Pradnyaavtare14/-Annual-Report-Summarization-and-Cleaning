The application developed is a PDF summarization tool that reads a given PDF file, extracts its content, generates a summary for each page, and allows users to download the summary as a well-organized PDF. The main components include:

Key Features:

PDF Upload and Text Extraction:
The first step in the application is to allow users to upload a PDF file. This is done through Streamlit's file uploader widget.

Text Summarization:
The extracted text is then passed to the Sumy library to generate summaries.
Sumy is a library that provides various summarization algorithms such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), TextRank, and others.

Organized Display of Summaries:
The summaries are displayed in a clean and organized manner:

Downloadable Summary PDF:
After the summaries are generated and displayed, users are given the option to download a summary as a PDF document.
ReportLab, a powerful library for creating PDFs, is used to generate a formatted PDF file of the summary.
The create_pdf function takes the summary data and formats it in a well-organized manner, including:

Technologies Used:
Streamlit:
Streamlit is the main web framework used to develop the user interface. It makes it easy to build interactive applications with minimal code.
Streamlit's widgets like st.file_uploader, st.write, st.markdown, and st.download_button are used to facilitate file upload, display content, and allow PDF downloads.

PyPDF2:
PyPDF2 is used for reading the PDF file and extracting text from each page. It is a pure Python library that can work with PDF documents and allows easy access to page-level content.

Sumy:
Sumy is a text summarization library that provides various algorithms to summarize text. We use the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) summarizer to generate a summary by reducing the dimensionality of the text.

ReportLab:
ReportLab is a Python library used for creating PDF documents. It is used here to generate a neat and formatted summary PDF. It offers control over page layout, fonts, and content placement, making it ideal for custom document generation.
